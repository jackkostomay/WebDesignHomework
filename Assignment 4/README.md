*Explain how web browsers function. How do web browsers really work behind the scenes?*


Behind the scenes there is a rendering engine which takes a blank website and turns it into whatever you want. Then there is the browser engine which connects the user to the rendering engine. The rendering engine reads the HTML document and creates a Document Object Model (DOM).
